Repository contains code about introduction and few experiments and model architecture implementation in Jax. Jax is particularly my favourite neural network library other than tensorflow. 
Obvious reasons being, it is highly flexible and can program experimental and research code at ease. Unfortunately, jax is not full-blown library like Tensorflow/PyTorch and much aspects are stole from Trax & Flax.

I wanted to get to the depths of Jax, not an expert in Jax honestly and many of the programming concepts are a bit advanced for me since, I am not used to such functional style programming. But, the potential of Jax both as a library and tool is huge and impact too. Which is why, I decied to teach myself Jax. 

this repository has notbooks from introduction to Jax to perform some high level experiments and AI model architecture implementation in JAX. I have studied a few lecture notes from University of Amsterdam, Sharp bits and Official Jax documentation to understand all the fundamental to advanced JAX components and compiled them here. I am not providing any tutorials rather it is for my personal study. If you still have any questions, kindly start an issue on this repository and I will try to help.
